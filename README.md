Advertising fraud is constantly eating away at the marketing ecology, and anti-fraud has become a key issue in the field of digital marketing that needs to be broken.

Objective:
This contest provides a large amount of current network traffic data from the AI marketing cloud as a training sample, and contestants need to build models based on the samples provided to predict whether traffic cheats or not.

Data description:
The competition provides contestants with 5 types of data: basic data, media information, time, IP information and device information. The basic data provides the ad request session sid, as well as the "cheating" identification.

Media information, time, IP information, and device information, 4 categories of data, provide syllable information that may be helpful to cheating estimates. For data security reasons, all data is desensitated. The dataset provides a sample of several days, the last day of data is used for prediction, the data for the remaining dates is not given as training data.
